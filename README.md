# Lab Instructions

Here we will be constructing our own merge sort. 
Using the `sort()` method, write in your logic for merge sorting a series of integers. 
The method will be provided an **unsorted** array of integers as a parameter. 
What should be returned is an array in **ascending** order. 

Ex: 

`input -> [3,2,5,1,4]`

`output -> [1,2,3,4,5]`

Be sure to be mindful of the array indices as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionsare` very common.

## Running the Tests

The lab comes with tests that will verify the correct functionality.
