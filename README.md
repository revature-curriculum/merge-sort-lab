# Lab Instructions

Here we will be constructing our own merge sort. 
Using the `mergeSort()` method, write in your logic for merge sorting a series of integers. 
The method will be provided an **unsorted** array of integers as a parameter along with the **length of the array** as `n`. 
What should be printed is an array in **ascending** order. 

Ex: 
`input -> [3,2,5,1,4]`

`output -> [1,2,3,4,5]`

Be sure to be mindful of the array indices as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions` are very common.

## Testing
### Your own testing
You can conduct your own testing and debugging as you please by inserting `System.out.print()`. However, we do have our own set of test cases. 

### Running our Tests
The lab comes with a couple of pre-built tests cases that will verify the correct functionality of your implementation. Go over to the **check mark** on the left hand side of the IDE and hit **Run tests**.
All green means you have passed the test cases.
Red will mean you failed a test case, or an error occured.
Read the stack trace to investigate why you are not passing the test cases.
